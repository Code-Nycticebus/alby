# alby

alby is a low level virtual machine that interpretes bytecode and simulates cpu instructions. These instructions are inspired by those of x86_64 assembly.
I use [pybuildc], my own buildsystem to build this.

### Install (Not Implemented)
This build script is generated by [pybuildc].
```terminal
sudo sh install.sh
```

### Usage
#### Compile
Compile files to bytecode.
```terminal
alby examples/fib.lsd -c ./fib
```
#### Run source file
Compiles file to bytecode and runs bytecode afterwards. 
```terminal
alby example/fib.lsd -r ./fib
```
#### Run bytecode
Run a bytecode file.
```terminal
alby ./fib
```
